Throughout my time at SNHU, I’ve worked on projects involving computer graphics, databases, full-stack applications, and web applications. I’ve developed a program to render objects, lights, and shadows using OpenGL, which required me to understand algorithms for calculating shadows and rendering depth maps. I’ve also developed web applications for a few of my SNHU courses, both of which interfaced with databases to populate information throughout the website. During my time here, I’ve learned about secure coding practices and what goes into cybersecurity, particularly how security starts from design. For the past few years, I’ve also been freelancing as a 2D game artist and concept artist, primarily working on an indie narrative puzzle game called Shards Between Us. Through working on Shards, I explored technical art, specifically shaders, which brings my illustration degree and my computer science degree together. My work on Shards also highlights my ability to collaborate with team members and communicate with potential stakeholders such as publishers as we have created and presented decks to secure funding. All these projects have required me to have a solid understanding of software engineering to implement, make changes, and debug.

The projects showcased in this portfolio show my ability to understand code, rendering pipelines, and how full-stack applications interact with databases to provide a fully functional experience. The first artifact is my modification of Unity’s default 2D Tile Editor package. I edited the code to better suit the Shards team. The second artifact uses OpenGL to render objects to the screen and includes lights and calculated cast shadows. The third and last artifact is a full-stack application for a travel-booking company. The application connects to a database to retrieve up-to-date trip and resort information.
