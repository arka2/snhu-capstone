Hi! My name is Arka Tu, and I'm a concept artist, 2D game artist, and technical artist based in Los Angeles! I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2020 with a BFA in Illustration. Since playing Wizard101 in middle school, I've wanted to work on games. I've worked at Flying Mollusk, known for their game Nevermind, and I've worked on tabletop games and the Cartomancy Anthology, a collection of 22 indie games inspired by the Major Arcana. I'm currently working on Shards Between Us, a narrative puzzler about three magical sisters and their family.

Outside of art and games, I figure skate and scrapbook.

Thanks for stopping by!
